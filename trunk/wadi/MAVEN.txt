Maven build not yet finished.

Requires : maven-1.0rc3, maven-aspectj-plugin-3.0

You will need to make the folowing hacks to your system to get anywhere.


1. hack a new jetty.jar built from cvs over the top of the one in your
.mave/repository - we need fixes that have not yet been released.

2. hack a source (and time) attribute into your
maven-aspectj--plugin-3.0.jar/plugin.jelly/ iajc task. We need it set
to 1.4.
