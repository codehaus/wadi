Implemented:

- Tomcat-5.2x/Jetty-5.1x
- [Fully spec compliant distributed HttpSession manager]
- Pluggable (in terms of length number of components and composition) Session storage stack (memory, disc, database, cluster)
- Session promotion/demotion up/down this stack is overlapped/transaction-aware for safety
- Pluggable Eviction strategies decide when to expire or demote sessions
- Pluggable Streaming Strategies (simple, gzip) applied when [de]serialising sessions
- Pluggable [de]serialisation strategies for non-Serializable Session Attributes
- Lazy Session Attribute deserialisation and activation notification
- Switchable Session serialisation strategies (Whole-Session, Per-Attribute)
- Transparent peer-to-peer session redistribution upon node shutdown
- Transparent on-demand session migration between nodes
- Migration of passivated session on node A to node B, without deserialisation ocurring on node A
- Transparent on-demand request proxying[/redirection] between nodes
- Pluggable session/request relocation strategies (migrate, proxy (HttpUrlConnection/Commons-HttpClient)[, redirect])
- auto-partitioning/healing clustering substrate
- Fully IOC
- Spring-wired
- Technologies: Java-1.4, AspectJ-1.2, ActiveCluster/MQ, and more ...


NYI :

- true p2p network - no single point of failure or contention
- request relocation via redirection (routing lbs only)
- integration of various lbs
- replication
- pluggable replication policies - immediate, request-group, timeout
- [strict LRU eviction...]

- OpenEJB
