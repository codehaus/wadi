    <h1>WADI - Web Application Distribution Infrastructure</h1>

    <h2>What is WADI?</h2>

    WADI is a J2EE component that manages and ensures the scalable and
    transparent high availability of Web container state.

    <p/>

      Such state is stored in an HttpSession. This is the server-side
      repository of client conversational state and the only resource
      to be distributed in a &lt;distributable/&gt; Web Application.

    <p/>

      Unfortunately, the management of distributable HttpSessions
      tends to be very much an afterthought in both the current
      Servlet specification and existing Open Source implementations.

    <p/>

      WADI's goal is to identify and explain the shortcomings present
      in current offerings and to provide an implementation which
      draws upon this crystallisation of the current state of play to
      provide a highly flexible toolkit capable of delivering a number
      of different solutions in a complex problem space.

    <p/>

      WADI is able to achieve this, because the project is focussed,
      not on the delivery of a complete, working web-container, but
      simply upon the problem of distributed state management.

    <p/>

      Ultimately, WADI will live or die upon its ability to justify
      its architecture in terms of the constraints placed upon it by
      the Servlet and Java language specifications and to deliver a
      production-ready implementation of this in a format that is
      sufficiently performant, flexible, functional and available as
      to be worth the investment, over and above just taking a vanilla
      web-container out of the box, that the user will have to make to
      put it to use.

    <p/>

      You are the Jury. Your verdict is final!

    <h2>With what Web Containers does WADI integrate?</h2>

    Currently, only Jetty, although a Tomcat integration has been
    planned from the outset and is well under way.

    <h2>How is it integrated?</h2>

    WADI comprises two main components, A portable HttpSession
    implementation and an HttpSession Manager. The Manager has
    implementations that plug into Jetty and Tomcat, replacing their
    existing HttpSession Managers. HttpSessions will be able to be
    exchanged between instances of any WADI-enabled web-container.

    <h2>What functionality does WADI bring to the table?</h2>

    Managing distributed state is a complex affair. Rather than
    mandate a particular direction, WADI attempts to abstract the
    basic patterns of use into Policy interfaces. A number of
    different such Policy plugins, governing e.g. eviction, migration,
    Id generation etc, ship with WADI, and the user is encouraged to
    write their own implementations and submit them to the project to
    fill any functional gaps.

    <p/>

      Currently WADI can:

    <p/>
      In a non-distributed environment:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Perform the full set of duties of a standard session manager.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p/>
    In a distributed environment:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Persist sessions via a pluggable MigrationPolicy between web
	container start/stop cycles. All the correct notifications
	will be triggered upon HttpSessionActivationListeners.
      </li>
      <li>
	Select, according to a user supplied EvictionPolicy, sessions
	for Passivation and using the above MigrationPolicy, move them
	into shared storage, from which they may be re-activated, in a
	race-safe environment, by any web-container instance that
	shares the store. Once again, the correct notifications will
	be made to session Listeners.
      </li>
      <li>
	Reference based semantics (See WADI Paper - LINK TODO) may be
	completely maintained in a distributed environment. We believe
	this is the only Open Source Session Manager to be able to do
	this reliably. i.e., any legacy webapp, provided that it
	stores client state exclusively in the corresponding http
	session, may be deployed in distributed mode with no further
	code changes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p/>
      In the future we expect WADI to be able to:

    <ul>
      <li>
	draw on existing functionality to provide performant and
	flexible high availibility and scalability of it's managed
	state, via a variety of pluggable backends.
      </li>
      <li>
	because of it's flexibility, WADI should provide a platform
	with which a number of mission critical third party product
	integrations (e.g. http load-balancers) will be able to be
	tightly integrated, resolving many of the existing problems in
	providing clustered web-tier state management.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why would I even want to store important information in the Web tier ?</h2>

    Strictly speaking, data associated with presentation lives in the
    web tier whilst data associated with the business should be stored
    in the EJB tier.

    <p/>

      State management in the EJB tier is more tightly specified,
      simpler and generally better implemented than the equivalent
      functionality in the web-tier, so the tendancy has been to push
      all important data in this direction, when high availibility and
      fail-over are a major concern.

    <p/>

      Unfortunately, even designs such as the above cannot get away
      from the fact that the web-client requires a single handle on
      the conversational state held in some J2EE tier and that the
      only such handle provided by the J2EE specifications is that
      which binds a url parameter/session cookie to a web session. So
      whilst you can store all data in the EJB tier, unless you want
      to start learning proprietary tricks to associate an EJB handle
      with a web client, you have no option but to put your EJB into
      the relevant web session and pray that it survives whatever gets
      thrown at it.

    <p/>

      This is obviously an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and WADI's
      aim is to restore confidence in the reliability of web sessions
      in general and to clearly demonstrate, that with a little
      thought, in a number of cases, a distributed web session may be
      implemented more efficiently and reliably than the corresponding
      stateful EJB session.
