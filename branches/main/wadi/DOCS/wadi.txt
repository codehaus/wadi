WADI Server receives a command and executes it, within a WadiContext.
The Command encapsulates some args.  A conversation is a two-way,
synchronous exchange of commands a Command can be
e.g. MigrationCommand.begin, do, commit/rollback etc.

Buddies should send PingCommands to each other regularly, to confirm
that connections are live and that the servers behind them are
functioning.

They should probably arrange themselves in a circle where each node
Pings the Node N+1.

If a node thinks that another node has died it asks everyone elses
opinion.

If a node is shut down cleanly, it would send a ShutDownNotification
to N-1 - or maybe everyone...

NO

Perhaps the Ping should circulate around the cluster - but everyone
pings all their buddies... think about this
