    <h1>
      Distributable J2EE Web Applications
      <br/>
      A Container Provider's View of the current Servlet Specification.
    </h1>
    The
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/download.html#specs">
      'Java(tm) Servlet Specification, Version 2.4'
    </a>
    makes a number of references to 'distributable' web applications
    and httpsession 'migration'. It states that compliant deployments
    "...can ensure scalability and quality of service features like
    load-balancing and failover..." (SRV.7.7.2). In today's demanding
    enterprise environments, such features are increasingly
    required. This paper sets out to distil and understand the
    relevant contents of the specification, construct a model of the
    functionality that this seems to support, assess this
    functionality with regard to feasibility and popular requirements
    and finally make suggestions as to how a compliant implementation
    might be architected.
    <h2>
      Prerequisites.
    </h2>
    TODO - A good understanding of what an HttpSession is, what it is
    used for and how it behaves will be necessary for a full
    understanding of this content. A comprehensive grasp of the
    requirements driving architectures towards clustering and of
    common cluster components (such as load-balancers) will also be
    highly beneficial.
    <h2>
      The Servlet Specification - distilled:
    </h2>
    When a webapp declares itself &lt;distributable/&gt; it enters into a
    contract with it's container. The Servlet Specification includes a dry
    bones description of this contract which we will distil from it and
    flesh out in this paper.
    <p/>
      For a successful outcome the implementors of both Container and
      Containee need to be agreed on exactly what behaviour is expected of
      each other. For a really deep understanding of the contract they will
      need to know why it is as it is (TODO - This paper will provide such a
      view, from both sides).
    <p/>
      The Specification mandates the following behaviour for distributable
      Servlets:
    <p/>

    <h3>
      Non-Distributable Servlets
    </h3>
    Only Servlets deployed within a webapp may be distributable. (TODO -
    Ed.: is there any other standard way to deploy a Servlet? Perhaps
    through the InvokerServlet?) (SRV.3.2) TODO - WHY?

    <h3>
      Single Threaded Servlets
    </h3>
    SingleThreadedModel Servlets, whilst discouraged (since it is
    generally more efficient for the Servlet writer, who understands the
    problem domain, to deal with application synchronisation issues) are
    limited to a single instance pool per JVM.(SRV.2.3.3.1)

    <h3>
      Multi-Threaded Servlets
    </h3>
    Multithreaded HttpServlets are restricted to one Servlet
    instance per JVM, thus delegating all application
    synchronisation issues to a single point where the Servlet's
    writer may resolve them with application-level
    knowledge (SRV.2.2).

    <h3>
      Distributable State
    </h3>
    The only state to be distributed will be the HttpSession. Thus all
    application state that requires distribution must be housed in an
    HttpSession or alternative distributed resource (e.g. EJB, DB,
    etc.). The contents of the ServletContext are NOT distributed.
    (SRV.3.2, SRV.3.4.1, SRV.14.2.8)

    <h3>
      HttpSession Migration
    </h3>

    Moving HttpSessions between process boundaries (i.e. from JVM to
    JVM, or JVM to store) is termed 'migration'.In order that the
    container should know how to migrate application-space Objects,
    stored in an HttpSession, they must be of mutually agreed type.

    <p/>

      In a J2EE (Version 1.4) environment (e.g. in a web container
      embedded in an application server), the set of supported types
      for HttpSession attributes is as follows, although web
      containers are free to extend this set (J2EE.6.4): (Note that
      using an extended type would impact your webapp's portability).

    <p/>

    <ul>
      <li><code>java.io.Serializable</code></li>
      <li><code>javax.ejb.EJBObject,</code></li>
      <li><code>javax.ejb.EJBHome</code></li>
      <li><code>javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject</code></li>
      <li><code>javax.ejb.EJBLocalHome</code></li>
      <li><code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code> (TODO ??)</li>
      <li>"a <code>javax.naming.Context</code> object for the java:comp/env context" (TODO)</li>
    </ul>
    <p/>

      Breaking this contract through use of an unagreed type will
      result in the container throwing an
      <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> upon its introduction to
      the HttpSession, since the container must maintain the
      migratability of this resource (SRV.7.7.2).

    </li>

    <h3>
      Migration Implementation
    </h3>
    How migration is actually implemented is undefined and left up to
    the container provider (SRV.7.7.2). The application is not even
    guaranteed that the container will use <code>readObject()</code>
    and <code>writeObject()</code> (TODO explain) methods if they are
    present on an attribute. The only guarantee given by the
    specification is that their "serializable closure" will be
    "preserved" (SRV.7.7.2). This is to allow the container provider
    maximum flexibility in this area.

    <h3>
      HttpSessionActivationListener
    </h3>
    The specification describes an
    <code>HttpSessionActivationListener</code> interface. Attributes
    requiring notification before or after migration can implement
    this. The container will call their <code>willPassivate()</code>
    method just before passivation, thus giving them the chance to
    e.g. release non-serialisable resources. Immediately after
    activation the container will call their
    <code>didActivate()</code> method, giving them the chance to
    e.g. reacquire such resources. (SRV.7.7.2, SRV.10.2.1, SRV.15.1.7,
    SRV.15.1.8). Support for a number of other such listeners are
    required in a compliant implementation, but these are not directly
    related to session migration.

    <h3>
      HttpSession Affinity
    </h3>
    Given that:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Multiple instances of a distributable webapp will be running
	in multiple different JVMs within our proposed cluster
      </li>
      <li>
	A client browser may throw multiple concurrent requests
	for the same session at this cluster
      </li>
      <li>
	The spirit of the specification and performance
	requirements call for such a grouping of requests to be
	processed concurrently, rather than serially,
      </li>
    </ul>
    we can see that any implementation must resolve these
    apparently contradictory issues satisfactorily.

    <p/>

      The Servlet Specification states:

    <p/>

      "All requests that are part of a session must be handled by
      one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at a time." (SRV.7.7.2).

    <p/>

      The intention of this statement is to resolve such
      concurrency issues. It prunes the tree of possible
      implementations substantially, insisting that all concurrent
      requests for a particular session are delivered to the same
      node.

    <p/>

      Delivering requests for the same session to the same node is
      known variously as 'session affinity', 'sticky sessions',
      persistent sessions' etc., depending on your container's
      vendor. The specification is trading complexity in the
      web-container tier for complexity in the load-balancer
      tier. This added requirement will impact the latency of this
      tier, in that the load-balancer will generally need to parse the
      uri or headers of each http request travelling through it (in a
      non-encrypted form) in order to extract the target session
      id. However, the reduction of potentially awkward concurrency
      issues/race conditions in the web-container tier is a gain
      considered worth this sacrifice.

    <p/>

      It is worth noting that, since we have now introduced a
      requirement for the load-balancer tier to have knowledge of
      the location of httpsessions within the web-container tier,
      the ability to 'migrate' these objects may, therefore,
      require a certain amount of coordination between the two
      tiers.

    <h3>
      Background Threads
    </h3>
    <p/>

      The previous requirement reduces our problem from race
      conditions between distributed objects in different JVMs, to a
      situation where we simply have to manage coordination between
      multiple threads in the same JVM. The purpose of this
      coordination is to ensure that access to container managed
      resources that are available to multiple concurrent application
      space threads is properly synchronised.

    <p/>

      Whilst the container has implicit knowledge about any thread,
      executing application code, for the lifecycle of which it is
      responsible (i.e. request threads), it has no control over any
      thread that is entirely managed by application code - Background
      thread. Such threads might execute across request boundaries,
      accessing otherwise predictably dormant resources that might
      otherwise be passivated or migrated elsewhere.

    <p/>

      Fortunately, the specification also recommends that references
      to container-managed objects should not be given to threads that
      have been created by an application (SRV.2.3.3.3, SRV.S.17) and
      whose lifecycle is not entirely bounded by that of a request
      thread. The container is encouraged to generate warnings if this
      should occur. Application developers should understand that
      recommendations such as this become all the more important when
      working in a distributed environment.

    <p/>

      This concept of "container-managed objects" needs more careful
      discussion and we shall look at it more closely later.

    <h3>
      HttpSession Events
    </h3>

    <p/>

      Finally, given that HttpSessions are the only type to be
      distributed and that they should only ever be in one JVM at one
      time, it should come as no surprise that ServletContext and
      HttpSession events are not propagated outside the JVM in which
      they were raised (SRV.10.7) as this would result in container
      owned objects becoming active in a JVM through which no relevant
      request thread was passing.

    <h2>
      Is this adequate ?
    </h2>

    Armed now with a deeper understanding of exactly what the
    specification says about distributable webapps, we can begin to
    speculate on what a compliant implementation might look like.

    <p/>

      The specification has done a reasonably good job of outlining our area
      of interest. Before implementing a container, however, there are a
      number of issues that we still need to address.

    <h3>
      Catastrophic failure
    </h3>

    <p/>

      TODO -
      Looking at what this specification actually says about
      distributable webapps, it can be seen immediately that it seems
      to reliably outline a mechanism for the controlled shutdown of a
      node and the attendant migration of it's sessions to [an]other
      node[s], or persistant storage.

    <p/>

      The ability to migrate sessions on controlled shutdown is useful
      functionality (maintenance will be one of the main reasons
      behind the occurrence of session migration), but it does not go
      far enough for many enterprise-level users, who require a
      solution capable of transparent recovery, without data loss,
      even in the case of a node's catastrophic failure. If a node is
      simply switched off, thus having no chance to perform a shutdown
      sequence, then volatile state will simply be lost. It is too
      late to call HttpSessionActivationListener.willPassivate() where
      necessary and serialise all user state to a safe place!
      Container implementors must ask themselves the question - 'What,
      within the bounds of the current specification, can we do to
      mitigate this event?'.

    <p/>

      Before moving into more detailed discussion about session
      migration we need to discuss the synchronisation of session
      attributes and to introduce the concepts of 'Reference vs. Value
      Based Semantics' and 'Object Identity'.

      <h3>
      Session Attribute Synchronisation
      </h3>

    <p/>

      We have shown that there are many times at which a container may
      wish to take a backup copy, via serialisation, of a session or
      session attribute. In a multi-threaded environment the container
      needs to be able to ensure a consistent view of the object that
      it is backing up. i.e. the object must remain unchanged
      throughout the process of serialisation, otherwise the backup
      copy can not be guaranteed valid.

    <p/>

      If we classify session attributes as "container-managed
      objects", then we can see that the specification 'recommends'
      their references not being given to any application thread
      running beyond the scope of a request. This means that, provided
      that no request threads for this session are running in the
      container, we can be assured of thread-safe access to it's
      attributes and thus a consistent snapshot of the session's
      state.

    <p/>

      If we classify sessions but not session attributes as
      "container-managed objects", then this assumption breaks down.

    <p/>

      Even given this asumption, backing up of sessions when a
      relevant request or background thread is running (e.g. 'When'
      policies 'Immediate' and 'Request') become problematic. This is
      unfortunate, because inability to implement these policies
      impacts on the guarantees that the container can make and thus
      the quality of service that it can offer.

    <p/>

      These issues are not isolated to the management of HttpSessions,
      they are present throughout distributed software
      architectures. Aside from an explicit synchronisation protocol a
      common and practical solution is to alter the semantics of object equality.

    <p/>

      Because the design of HttpSessions did not originally encompass their distributability

      - explicit session attribute synchronisation protocol between
      application and container code.

      - shift from reference to value based semantics

      Object Identity is also an issue.




    <h3>
      Reference vs Value Based Semantics - TODO - needs refactoring.
    </h3>

    Given the following Servlet code snippet:

    <pre>
    Foo foo1=new Foo();
    session.setAttribute("foo", foo1);
    Foo foo2=session.getAttribute("foo");
    </pre>

    Which of these assertions (assuming that <code>Foo.equals()</code>
    is well implemented) would you expect to be true?

    <ul>
      <li>
	<pre>
    foo1==foo2;
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
	<pre>
    foo1.equals(foo2);
	</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p/>

      If you expect <code>foo1==foo2</code> then you are expecting
      reference-based semantics.

    <p/>

      If you are expecting reference-based semantics you might well
      write code such as this in order to avoid unnecessary
      de/rehashes:

    <pre>
    Point p=new Point(0,0);
    session.setAttribute("point", p);
    p.setX(100);
    p.setY(100);
    </pre>

    and then might expect that :

    <pre>
    ((Point)session.getAttribute("point")).getX()==100;
    </pre>

    <p/>

      Using value based-semantics, out of these three (TODO)
      assertions, only the second of the equality tests would succeed.

    <p/>

      Every parameter passed to and from a value based API must be
      assumed to be copied from an original, since it may have come
      across the wire from another address space.

    <p/>

      For this reason, when you start dealing with (possibly) remote
      objects in a distributed scenario, you generally shift your
      semantics from reference to value. (c.f. Remote EJB APIs)

    <p/>

      Unfortunately, the Servlet Specification, whilst clearly
      mandating that every session attribute must be of a type that
      the container knows how to move from VM to VM omits to mention
      that a possible impact of doing this is an important shift in
      semantics. This is exacerbated by the fact that, unlike EJBs,
      which have been designed specifically for distributed use, the
      httpsession API does not change (c.f. Local/Remote) according to
      the semantic that is required, which is simply a single
      deployment option. This encourages developers to believe that
      they can make a webapp that has been written for Local use, into
      a fully functional distributed component, simply by adding the
      relevant tag to the web.xml. All attendant problems are
      delegated, by spec and developer, to the unfortunate container
      provider.

    <p/>

      Thus the container provider must make a choice here

      <ul>
      <li>
	continue to support reference-based semantics in which case
	migration may only occur when there are no active threads for
	a session and there is an implicit contract between container
	and containee that objects deriving from a session will not
	have their references compared to objects deriving from
	elsewhere, whose lifecycles may span across such periods.
      </li>
      <li>
	make an explicit new contract that states that all interaction
	with session attributes is by value and comparisons should
	only be made in this way. The full ramifications of this
	choice should become apparent as we progress further in this
	paper.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Object Identity, Object Streams and Synchronisation
    </h3>

    <p/>

      TODO - I guess Object Identity can only be preserved within a
      single Object tree ? so attribute-based distribution will not
      recognise the same object shared between different attributes

    <p/>

      How can we guarantee, unless we know that no other threads are
      running, the synchronisation of values as we stream them out of
      the container ?

    <h3>
      Session Backup - When
    </h3>

    <p/>

      The answer to the concern of lost data is to frequently ship
      backup copies off-node, so that in the case of its catastrophic
      failure, we have a fallback position. The freshness of our
      backup data depends directly on the frequency of this
      process. This frequency is bounded by resource concerns and the
      contract between container and containee, as discussed above.

    <p/>
      Let us examine some of the possibilities:

    <ul>
      <li>
	Immediate - As soon as a change is made to a session, it is
	backed up.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Most Accurate - This policy constrains our window of
	    data-loss as much as is reasonably possible.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Most Expensive - This accuracy has a cost. Every write to
	    a session object will result in expensive back up code
	    being triggered.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    TODO - Without some agreement on value-based semantics or
	    attribute synchronisation, the container cannot guarantee
	    thread-safety as it serialises its backup.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Request - All changes to a session are backed up at the end of
	each relevant request.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Less Accurate - This is less accurate than the 'Immediate'
	    policy described above, since a failure halfway through a
	    request thread would result in the loss of all changes
	    that it had made to it's session.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Less Expensive - Since backups are only done at the end of
	    each request, they will be fewer than 'Immediate' mode,
	    resulting in much less expense.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Inconsistency - Assuming that the session is somehow in a
	    'consistent' state at the end of each request is
	    misguided, since multiple requests may overlap. Although,
	    it may be, with the benefit of knowledge of the
	    application at one's disposal, that this problem can be
	    safely discounted.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Since there may be more application threads than just this
	    request running in the container, this policy suffers the
	    same synchronisation/semantic issues as 'Immediate',
	    although to a lesser extent.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Request Group - All changes to a session are backed up as soon
	as all associated active requests have been processed.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Less Accurate - This policy will be less accurate still,
	    if requests for the same session overlap within the
	    container.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Less Expensive - For the above reason this will lead to it
	    being still less expensive.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Consistency - This policy guarantees that what it backs up
	    is a consistent view of the session's contents. No request
	    is only half processed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Thread-Safe - The real win for this policy is that, with
	    no contract between containee and container regarding
	    attribute synchronisation/semantics, other than that
	    described in the Servlet Specification, the container may
	    access session attributes for backup, in the knowledge
	    that no other application code is concurrently modifying
	    them.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	WebApplication - Backup occurs in line with web application
	lifecycle. i.e. Not until the web application is
	<code>stop()</code>-ed by it's container.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This policy gives no protection against catastrophic
	    failure, but is fine for maintenance-only scenarios.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    There is no associated runtime overhead.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    As with the 'Request Group' policy, there are no
	    consistency or synchronisation issues. All request and
	    background threads will have terminated before the session
	    is backed up.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Timed - 'dirty' sessions are backed up at regular intervals,
	orthogonal to the lifecycles of requests, web applications
	etc...
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This might conceivably be useful to overlay on top of
	    e.g. the 'Request' policy if your request threads took a
	    long time to run, or the 'RequestGroup' policy if you
	    expected long periods without backing up because of many
	    overlapping requests for he same session.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    A backup policy that worked in the manner would be of
	    conveniently tunable accuracy and impact.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    However such a policy would suffer from all the
	    synchronisation and semantic issues common to 'Immediate'
	    and 'Request' approaches.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      TODO - NEEDS CONCLUDING
    <p/>
    <h3>
      Session Backup - What ?
    </h3>

    <p/>

      Once we have decided when to backup, we must think about what to
      backup. Candidates include the following:

    <ul>
      <li>
	Session - We backup the whole session every time it changes.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Simple - This is the simple, brute-force solution.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Expensive - This will be an expensive approach if there
	    are e.g. many attributes in your session and you regularly
	    touch one of them.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Robust - Even if a backup message went astray, perhaps due
	    to a failure in your transport, the next change to the
	    session would bring the off-node backup fully up to date.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Object identity may be maintained across the scope of the
	    whole session. If the same object appears multiple times
	    in your session, then this may be an important feature and
	    worth the price.
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Delta - Every time some change occurs to the session,
	encapsulate this change in an object and back that up. Deltas
	may be batched until the 'When' policy flushes this onto the
	distribution layer.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This is a more complex solution, requiring infrastructure
	    capable of detecting changes and classes to encapsulate
	    these.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This will be a more lightweight solution in the case of
	    sessions with many attributes and few changes but the
	    additional complexity might outweigh this benefit in the
	    case of a very small session.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This solution depends more upon the reliability of the
	    transport used to distribute the backups, since if one is
	    lost, the backup may become invalid. To be guaranteed
	    valid, it must contain the complete set of changes that
	    have occurred to the session, correctly ordered (TODO:
	    excepting some optimisation which we will discuss later).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Object identity may only be scoped within the delta. If
	    the same object appears multiple time in the same session,
	    both inside and outside the delta, object identity will
	    not be preserved and reference-based semantics will break
	    down.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	All Sessions - This, of course can only be done if you select
	'WebApp' as your 'When' policy.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    A major win in this strategy is that Object Identity may
	    be scoped across all sessions. i.e. if you have common
	    objects referenced by many different sessions,
	    reference-based semantics will hold for them, since all
	    sessions will be serialised together in a single
	    synchronised block.

    <h3>
      HttpSessionActivationListener:
    </h3>

    <p/>

      The Servlet Specification has one final curve ball to throw at
      the Container Provider here. We have already seen how
      <code>HttpSessionActivationListener</code>s are notified around
      passivation/activation. Assuming that they require this in order
      to prepare themselves for serialisation, or recover from
      deserialisation it is likely that when the container calls their
      <code>willPassivate()</code> method, that they will move to a
      new state that, whilst valid for serialisation, is invalid for
      normal runtime operation. They might e.g. release a resource
      that would be too expensive or awkward to passivate, knowing
      that they can reacquire a replacement upon re-activation.

    <p/>

      Imagine now that rather than simply migrate a session from one
      node to another, we are simply taking a backup of it at the end
      of a request group, a guard point against the node's
      catastrophic failure. If we simply call
      <code>willPassivate()</code> and then serialise a copy into our
      backup store, we will have the backup that we required, but will
      have left the attribute in a state which may mean it is invalid
      for normal operations

    <p/>

      The solution is to call <code>didActivate()</code> immediately
      after taking the copy, thus restoring the attribute to its
      previous valid state. In effect the backup procedure may be
      thought of as a mini-migration off a node and then straight back
      onto it again, leaving a spare copy off-node.

    <p/>

      This has interesting ramifications for the whole 'Session'
      backup policy which may end up doing this to many attributes
      which have not actually been added or altered since the last
      backup was taken. If this involves an expensive release and
      reacquisiton of resources, the impact may be substantial. The
      'Delta' policy will not suffer from this inefficiency, since it
      will only concern itself with attributes that have changed.

    <h3>
      Optimisations
    </h3>

    <p/>

      TODO - These need to be discussed here so that we can draw upon
      them when discussing different impls.

    <ul>
      <li>
	lastAccessedTime - don't distribute, ignore until last minute
	?  <p/> If a node dies.all sessions upon it must be considered
	just touched, since a request thread for them may have caused
	the crash. Time of node death should be noted and associated
	with these sessions. upon rehydration this is the lastAcessed
	value that they should adopt.

	<p/>

	  TODO - perhaps move this into previous section - a naive
	  impl may..., but: maybe not - think about it...

	  Unfortunately, the specification requires that every session
	  object carries a 'LastAccessedTime' value. Which is updated
	  every time the session is retrieved by an application thread
	  for reading or writing. Thus any request requiring stateful
	  interaction within the webapp will have the side effect of
	  writing a change to the session. Taken literally these
	  changes can be very expensive in a distributable scenario as
	  a naive implementation will require each such change to be
	  exported to another vm in case of catastrophic node failure.
      </li>

      <li>
	Batching of deltas - compression of e.g. rem(X);set(X) or
	se(X);set(X) etc..
      </li>
      <li>

	TODO - lowering contention on session table...

	DefaultServlet is stateless (session will never be fetched) so
	can be excluded from the equation. This means that requests for
	images etc can be excluded from concurrent request groups,
	reducing them substantially. A smart lb would know about this
	and could relax affinity as well (although a caching tier might
	be serving this content before you hit the lb - this tier also
	needs coordination with web-container teir so it can be
	selectively flushed upon webapp redeployment).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Conclusions
    </h3>

    <p/>

      In conclusion, we have been able to show that, whilst the spec
      does not explicitly cater for recovery from catastrophic
      failure, it does provide the Container Provider with enough
      structure to be able to implement various solutions to this
      problem. Unfortunately, because of its implicit reference-based
      semantics and failure to impose a mandatory protocol for the
      synchronisation of distributable session attributes it does not
      go quite far enough to allow such implementations suffient room
      to manoeuvre that they can deliver optimium results.

    <p/>

      Given the current state of the specification, therefore, the
      solution space is an area of trade-off and compromise between
      not only accuracy and economy as might well be expected but also
      the semantics of reference, value and identity, which are really
      areas that should not be open to interpretation. Any application
      developer involving themselves in this would therefore be well
      advised to aqcuaint themselves fully with these concepts so as
      to be prepared for the unexpected side-effects that they are
      likely to cause.

      <p/>

      No single set of the above policies is likely to implement the
      desired "silver bullet", however, with a solid understanding of
      the issues involved and the route that various implementations
      take through this maze, the application architect has a much
      improved chance of a successful outcome.

      <p/>

      With this in mind, we may now survey existing implementations in
      the open source arena, with particular respect to the solutions
      that they have chosen to overcome the problems that we have
      identified.

    <h2>
      Current Open Source Implementations
    </h2>

    <h3>
      <a href="www.sf.net/projects/jetty">Jetty</a>
    </h3>

    The Jetty distribution contains a pluggable distributable session
    manager, written by the author, which relies on value-based
    semantics to implement an immediate, by default, delta-based
    replication strategy over JGroups (TODO - link), although other
    distribution policies, notably by CMP EJB and JBoss(tm) clustering
    (see below) are alos available.

    With mod_jk and session affinity, via a pluggable session id
    generator, backups may be done asynchronously, or if deployment
    happens under a dumb load-balancer, backups may be taken
    synchronously to ensure the consistency of the session no matter
    where in the cluster a request lands.

    <h3>
      Tomcat 4.x - Filip Hanik
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Tomcat 5.x - ???
    </h3>

    <h3>
      <a href="www.sf.net/projects/jboss">JBoss(tm)</a>
    </h3>

    JBoss(tm) contains a ClusteredHttpSession service (TODO - check
    name) which backs onto the JBoss clustering layer which is
    implemented through replication using JGroups (TODO -
    link). Replication is done on according to whole 'Session'
    policy. The regularity of the backing up depends on the Web
    Container making use of the service.

    <p/>

    The Jetty integration provides a pluggable 'Store' component which
    allows it to make use of this medium. Backups are taken
    immediately any change is made to a session. Jetty's other
    distribution policies may also be used.

    <p/>

    The Tomcat integration relies on this service for it's
    transport. (TODO - finish). CONFIRM.

    <h3>
      Apache Geronimo (TODO - URL)
    </h3>

    The Geronimo implementation is currently being undertaken by the
    author of this paper, and therefore takes into account all points
    raised herein.

    TODO - Look into Geronimo impl... SRV.10.6 Listener Exceptions

    TODO - we can use a SecurityManager to prevent background threads
    being created. We can prevent access from such a thread to a
    container managed object, but we can't prevent such a reference
    being held by such a thread...

    <p/>

      does anything else other than session need to be distributed ?

      <li>security info</li>
      <li>application level data (as opposed to user level)</li>
      <li>etc</li>

    <p/>

      TODO - replication is faster than shared-store because
      'getAttribute' is not a remote call. Effectively, with
      replication, each replicant IS a shared store which processes
      requests locally.

    <p/>

      have we mentioned that migration is bad because cache hits go
      down ?

    <p/>

      Q for Niall - if Object Identity table is scoped within a single
      ObjectOutputStream, then howcome contention on this table is
      meant to be a VM-wide problem ? Since the table only appears to
      scope the lifecycle of a single instance of this stream, how
      could it make sense for it to be a longlived global construct?
