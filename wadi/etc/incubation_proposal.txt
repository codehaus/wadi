Proposal for WADI (Web Application Distribution Infrastructure) to Join Geronimo 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 0 : Rationale
---------------------
Achieving software infrastructure scalability is a tenet of Return on Investment (ROI) for any IT infrastructure and usually takes place in two forms: vertical scalability and horizontal scalability. Vertical addresses the scalability within the software itself whereas horizontal deals with it from the amount of hardware that can be added. 

Clustering, load balancing and failover is a necessity for any application server to be taken seriously in the enterprise in terms of scalability. Without the ability to cluster the application server, vertical scalability cannot take place. Without such veritical scalability, applications built on top of it can only be scaled horizontally. In order to make Geronimo more enterprise ready, it needs to provide such vertical scalability. 

WADI is a clustering, load balancing and failover solution for the web application container tier. It currently supports both Jetty and Tomcat and plans are currently afoot to add full J2EE clustering functionality. WADI will help Geronimo to achieve vertical scalability. 


Section 0.1 : criteria
----------------------
We believe that this project has a continued probability of success at the ASF under the guidance of the Geronimo PMC. WADI already has a code base and a group of committers - only two of which are not already Geronimo committers. The following considerations have gone into this line of thinking: 

a) Meritocracy - The project will be meritocratic - the usual Apache
meritocracy rules would apply.

b) Community - The initial developer community will consist of the current WADI committers as well as the existing Geronimo developer community. As the project is integrated with Geronimo, we expect this community to grow. 

c) Alignment - The alignment of WADI with Geronimo is only one offering. WADI will also align nicely with Tomcat and possibly other projects at the ASF. 

d) License - WADI already utilizes the Apache License 2.0. 


Section 0.2 :  warning signs
----------------------------


Section 1 : scope of the project
--------------------------------


Section 2 : initial source from which the project is to be populated
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The initial source code will come from a subset of the code from the WADI project at Codehaus (http://wadi.codehaus.org/). 

Section 3: identify the ASF resources to be created
----------------------------------------------------

Section 3.1 : mailing lists

* wadi-dev
* wadi-user


Section 3.2: SVN repositories

* wadi


Section 3.3: JIRA

* WADI


Section 4: identify the initial set of committers
-------------------------------------------------
* Bruce Snyder (Castor, Geronimo PMC, ServiceMix, TranQL, WADI)
* Gianni Scenini [???]
* Jeff Genender (Geroniom PMC, OpenEJB, ServiceMix, Mojo, WADI)
* James Goodwill (WADI)
* Jules Gosnell (Jetty, Geronimo PMC, WADI)


Section 5: identify apache sponsoring individual
------------------------------------------------
[I think that James Strachan would sponsor WADI and possibly Geir Magnusson (???)]


Section 6: open issues for discussion
